This is the STABLE release of Genesis.  This means no features will
be added to this release--only bug fixes and patches.  There is also
a higher level of run-time stability for this release which you will
not have with the DEV release (alpha developmental).

      * cleanup config() and add a new 'cachelog parameter (Brad)
      * add logging of object name and size at all db_put()'s (Brad)
      * add pre-allocation to cBuf's (Brad)
      * add sync() builtin to allow cache_sync without backup (Brad)
      * fix pad to disallow 0 length pad string (Brad)
      * method cache fixes: don't flush cache in as many
        cases, and also cache negative method lookups (Bruce)
      * added a test for the above pad() bug, as well as
        some other missing tests. (Bruce)
      * added bufsub() and $buffer.bufsub() (Bruce)
      * Change task_stack() to let it obtain the stack for any
        given frame and to generate either line numbers or 
        opcode index values. (Bruce)
      * Add log_task_stack() and log_all_task_stacks() callable
        from C. (Bruce)
      * Re-enable AC_INLINE check in configure (Bruce)
      * cleanup cache.c to have a dirty list and reduce overhead of
        cache holder array (Brad)
      * Add linefeed to panic() message. (Bruce)
      * panic() now tries to call log_all_task_stacks(). (Bruce)
      * Integrate patch to support using doubles for the ColdC
        float type. (Brian, trivial modifications by Bruce and Brad)
      * Adjust size_* functions to all return Int. (Bruce)
      * html_escape needs to encode if there are doublequotes,
        otherwise Bruce's added case won't be used. (Allen Noe)
      * Corrected random(x)'s throw message for x < 1 (Allen Noe)
      * Make method_bytecode() act like list_method(), specifically
        not returning bytecode for methods on parent objects (Allen Noe)
      * Also fix a bug in method_bytecode where it checks the wrong
        variable.  (Allen Noe)
      * Win32 build fix involving VRELEASE. (Allen Noe)
      * Add func_init_0_to_2(). (Bruce)
      * Make stack() accept parameters to specify task id and 
        whether or not line numbers are desired. (Bruce)
      * Add 'log_malloc_size parameter for config(). (Bruce)
      * Add explode_quoted() patch. (Jeremy Weatherford)
      * Add calling_method() patch. (Allen Noe)
      * Make method_bytecode() output info on jumps. (Allen Noe)
      * Makefile fix, putting textdb.c into EVERYTHING_O (Jeff Dubrule)
      * Change binarydb/dbpack routines to read/write entire object at
        once going through a cBuf. (Brad)
      * Fix db_alloc to call grow_bitmap once when expanding to fit an
        object that's > the size of the standard increment (Brad)
      * Add ancestor caching to speed up has_ancestor() and coldcc.
        (Bruce, Brad)
      * Added a cache_check cache in handle_varcmd (Brad)
      * Minor code cleanups in binarydb.c (Brad)
      * Add percent done to coldcc compile and decompile (Brad)
      * valid() works on frobs (normal and handled-frobs). Tests
        added to the test suite. (Bruce)
      * Error handling optimization to shift expense from throw()
        to traceback(). (Bruce)
      * Add background cleaner thread to write dirty objects to disk (Brad)
      * Further method cache cleanups, including a config()
        option to control logging of information about
        invalidations. (Bruce)
      * If new and old parents lists are equal, change_parents()
        should do no work. (Including cache invalidations) (Bruce)
      * Add cache_stats() and related data gathering code. (Bruce)

1.1.9  [1-Oct-2000]
