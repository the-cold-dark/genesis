This is the STABLE release of Genesis.  This means no features will
be added to this release--only bug fixes and patches.  There is also
a higher level of run-time stability for this release which you will
not have with the DEV release (alpha developmental).

RELEASE INFORMATION:
1.2.0 [6-Jan-2001]
      * cleanup config() and add a new 'cachelog parameter (Brad)
      * add logging of object name and size at all db_put()'s (Brad)
      * add pre-allocation to cBuf's (Brad)
      * add sync() builtin to allow cache_sync without backup (Brad)
      * fix pad to disallow 0 length pad string (Brad)
      * method cache fixes: don't flush cache in as many
        cases, and also cache negative method lookups (Bruce)
      * added a test for the above pad() bug, as well as
        some other missing tests. (Bruce)
      * added bufsub() and $buffer.bufsub() (Bruce)
      * Change task_stack() to let it obtain the stack for any
        given frame and to generate either line numbers or 
        opcode index values. (Bruce)
      * Add log_task_stack() and log_all_task_stacks() callable
        from C. (Bruce)
      * Re-enable AC_INLINE check in configure (Bruce)
      * cleanup cache.c to have a dirty list and reduce overhead of
        cache holder array (Brad)
      * Add linefeed to panic() message. (Bruce)
      * panic() now tries to call log_all_task_stacks(). (Bruce)
      * Integrate patch to support using doubles for the ColdC
        float type. (Brian, trivial modifications by Bruce and Brad)
      * Adjust size_* functions to all return Int. (Bruce)
      * html_escape needs to encode if there are doublequotes,
        otherwise Bruce's added case won't be used. (Allen Noe)
      * Corrected random(x)'s throw message for x < 1 (Allen Noe)
      * Make method_bytecode() act like list_method(), specifically
        not returning bytecode for methods on parent objects (Allen Noe)
      * Also fix a bug in method_bytecode where it checks the wrong
        variable.  (Allen Noe)
      * Win32 build fix involving VRELEASE. (Allen Noe)
      * Add func_init_0_to_2(). (Bruce)
      * Make stack() accept parameters to specify task id and 
        whether or not line numbers are desired. (Bruce)
      * Add 'log_malloc_size parameter for config(). (Bruce)
      * Add explode_quoted() patch. (Jeremy Weatherford)
      * Add calling_method() patch. (Allen Noe)
      * Make method_bytecode() output info on jumps. (Allen Noe)
      * Makefile fix, putting textdb.c into EVERYTHING_O (Jeff Dubrule)
      * Change binarydb/dbpack routines to read/write entire object at
        once going through a cBuf. (Brad)
      * Fix db_alloc to call grow_bitmap once when expanding to fit an
        object that's > the size of the standard increment (Brad)
      * Add ancestor caching to speed up has_ancestor() and coldcc.
        (Bruce, Brad)
      * Added a cache_check cache in handle_varcmd (Brad)
      * Minor code cleanups in binarydb.c (Brad)
      * Add percent done to coldcc compile and decompile (Brad)
      * valid() works on frobs (normal and handled-frobs). Tests
        added to the test suite. (Bruce)
      * Error handling optimization to shift expense from throw()
        to traceback(). (Bruce)
      * Add background cleaner thread to write dirty objects to disk (Brad)
      * Further method cache cleanups, including a config()
        option to control logging of information about
        invalidations. (Bruce)
      * If new and old parents lists are equal, change_parents()
        should do no work. (Including cache invalidations) (Bruce)
      * Add cache_stats() and related data gathering code. (Bruce)
      * Add support for Obj*'s as a subtype of cData's. (Brad)
      # Add config('cleanerwait, ##) to control the number of seconds
        between cleaner thread runs (Brad)
      * Add config('cleanerignore, #[]) to give the cleaner thread objects
        to ignore, the key is the only relevant part. (Brad)
      * Add config('cachewatch, $obj) and config('cachewatchcount, ##)
        to log the call stack of a specific $obj every cachewatchcount
	dirtys. (Brad)
      * Add ability to get both size and char* data from an ident to avoid
        useless strlen() calls. (Bruce)
      * Avoid writing back size/offset values if they haven't changed in
        binarydb.c. (Bruce)
      * Lookup and bind native methods while compiling the DB so that they
        can be used within eval blocks in coldcc to let you test natives
        in the test suite. (Bruce)
      * data_cmp() compares objnums by their numerical value now. (Bruce)
      * New lookup implementation that uses Berkeley DB. (Bruce)
      * Add has_method() to ColdC to make up for catch ~methodnf and
        find_method() being so slow.  has_method() does and -must-
        search ancestry.  That's why it exists. (Bruce)
      * Added defines_var checking to coldcc to catch dead variables that
        are no longer defined on the ancestor. (Bruce)
        DISABLED: Bruce indicated performance issues (Brad)
      * don't save all of obj->string_tab's data, some can easily be
        rebuilt during unpack (Brad)
        DISABLED: TEC crashed with string tab corruption a few times
      * don't save an empty obj->method table (Bruce)
      * for dicts over 64 keys don't save all the infrastructure, just
        save the key and value lists and rebuild at unpack time (Bruce, Brad)
      * Add a define to build coldcc in parse only mode (Brad)
      * Fix a bunch of places where we didn't handle offsets into the
        binary file properly so that we can now build and run with LFS
        enabled.  Still needs configure work to auto-detect the right build
        flags (Brad)
      * Changed find_function to binary search for builtin functions during
        method compile (Brad)
      * Many textdb.c efficiency issues cleaned up: string copying reduced,
        idref_t passed by reference instead of value everywhere, keep track
        of idref_t->len to avoid strlen() calls (Brad)
      * Change data_from_literal to prealloc lists for 10 elements (Brad)
      * Rewrote string_parse to only do one pass over the string (Brad)
      * fix object size calculation in the case of an object with no name
        (Brad)
      * Fix leak of parents list in binarydb decompilation
      * Greatly reduce memory overhead of leaf objects by allowing methods
        structure to be NULL, move idents and strings data into methods
        structure to increase savings. (Brad)
      * added start of sorted_* list builtins, still buggy. (Bruce)
        NOTE: may crash, loose data, fail to sort properly.  Don't use.
      * Add extra argument for local port to callback for new incoming
        connections. [COMPAT] (Bruce)
      * Port to Mac OS X. (Bruce)
      * Remove regsub references (not implementd/used). (Bruce)
      * Fixed README. (Bruce)
      * Add memory_size() builtin to complement size() which deals with the
        on disk size of objects and data. (Brad)
      * Alter binary db's on-disk scribbling of deleted objects, now 0's the
        entire object's region rather than just the first block and no longer
        writes out 'delobj' as the first part of that block. (Brad)
      * Fix typo in a debug message in execute.c (Brad)
      * Fix object reference leak in textdb.c verify_native_methods() (Brad)
      * Fix sorted_delete() (Brad)
      * Remove unused variable root in textdb.c compile_cdc_file() (Brad)
      * Change string_tab_free() to release itself also (Brad)
      * Fix string_tab_free() to use efree rather than free directly (Brad)
      * Fix memory leak in lookup_bdb.c lookup_open() (Brad)
      * Cleanup memory.c to separate old vs new pile code (Brad)
      * Add free_pile() (Brad)
      * Cleanup memory at exit (Brad)
      * Optimize textdump decompilation some. (Bruce)
      * Integrate changes from 1.1.10 and 1.1.11 (Brad, Bruce)
      * Overhaul obj->file and obj->conn to use new obj->extras (Brad)
      * Add support for db4 (Brad)
