INSTALL/COMPILATION

To compile simply run 'configure' followed by 'make'.

Installation is vague, as most people prefer to shift the binaries
around, generally you should just copy 'coldcc' and 'genesis' to your
world directory (wherever it may be).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0-1 RELEASE INFORMATION

If you are using a 0.4-0 database, you can upgrade easilly.  Dump your
database to text (coldcc -d), edit it and search for the following
functions, replacing them with their native counterparts.  Make sure
you have the objects in your database for those counterparts, and that
the methods they are using are not already defined:

      hostname()      =>   $network.hostname()
      ip()            =>   $network.ip()
      status()        =>   $sys.status()
      next_objnum()   =>   $sys.next_objnum()
      version()       =>   $sys.version()
      strftime()      =>   $time.format()
      encode()        =>   $http.encode()
      decode()        =>   $http.decode()

The following function has also changed, in leiu of using the function name
'log()' for the logarithmic float function.

      log()           =>   dblog()

You will also have to update any calls to strfmt(), two changes to the
function have been made:

      1 - Data arguments are no longer specified in a list, instead
          they simply follow the format.
      2 - Formatting has changed, read the documentation at:

             http://www.cold.org/ColdC/Functions/strfmt.html

If you want coldcc to force override regular method definitions, when they
conflict with away native method definitions, use the '-f' (force override)
flag when you compile the binary database.  You can list the compiled native
methods and their default objects with the '-n' flag in coldcc.

NOTES

Verified to compile on:

    * FreeBSD 2.1-R
    * DEC OSF/1 2.0 (Note: it will have problems on a DEC alpha processor)
    * DEC Ultrix 4.4
    * Sun Solaris 2.5

You will get the best results in FreeBSD, as it is the development platform
so possible problems are immediately found.

POST 1.0 TODO:
    * overridable methods: change searching to take the first method
      found.  Do the check for !overridable methods at the time the method
      is set as !overridable, do not allow methods to be set as overridable
      if they are overriden on descendants.  Do not allow methods to be
      added if an ancestor defines it as !overridable.
    * file ops should use the builtin file descriptor functions
    * sanity checks are still not done, do them.
    * get execute to use file i/o, so calling execute would be paramount
      to using fopen() on a file (shag code from apache CGI)
    * get bind_native directive in textdumps to handle specifying alternate
      objects as well.
    * integrate some of the gdbm features (like gdbm_reorganize())
    * review all of the dbm routines for other possible logic errors
    * descendants()
    * Implement a more efficient malloc for our specific uses, perhaps
      build on top of phkmalloc.

Possiblilities:

    * servers bound to dead objects (what happens?)
    * forking (requires a bit of rewriting in the actual interpreter)
    * send_to() builtin, this would be equivalent to the simple loop:

          for obj in (.contents())
              obj.tell("you are all silly");

      Except for that it would be much more efficient.  Equivallently
      it would look like:

          send_to(.contents(), 'tell, ["you are all silly"]);

      This could be a native method.  Drawbacks: it is very abstract.

    * 'retry' jump (ala continue, etc, for catch statements)
    * "\n" in strings should be character '10', not '\' and 'n'.
    * PERL-extensions to regexps (i.e. \s etc)
    * optionally declare a set type for variables, ala:

          'type variable

      when it is declared, such as:

          arg 'string cmd, 'integer num, [more];
          var 'integer i, some, other, that;

      When the type is set, it is always that.

    * Declare the default value of a variable when starting, such as:

          var i = 1;

      Perhaps even allow expressions:

          var i = .default_value();
